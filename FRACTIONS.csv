,Numerals and their types,"Numerals and their types
","While number is just an idea of a value in our mind; numeral is a system that represents the given number using symbols, digits or words in a consistent manner. ",,,,
,,,"The Hindu Arabic numeral system or base ten number system uses ten numerical digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to represent numbers.",,,,
,,,"This system is positional as here numbers are formed by grouping digits and each digit has a fixed position. For example, digit 1 in the number 10 has a different position than its position in the number 01.",,,,
,,," The Roman numeral system consists of various specific symbols like I, V, X to represent numbers. Then these base symbols are combined to represent any number greater than 0.",,,,
,Place value and face value,Place value for 2 and 3 digit numerals,Place value is the value represented by a digit in a number on the basis of its position in the number. ,,,,
,,, The position of a digit in a number is determined from right to left. ,,,,
,,,The right-most digit in a number determines the number of ones or units and hence its place value is the number itself.,,,,
,,,The second digit from the right determines the number of tens and hence its place value is 10 times the same digit at the one's place. Thus 1 ten = 10 ones. Similarly the third digit from the right determines the number of hundreds and hence its place value is 100 times the same digit at the one's place. Thus 1 hundred = 100 ones,,,,
,,,Every progressive place value is the earlier place value multiplied by 10 as 10 groups of earlier place value makes a single unit that makes the progressive place value.,,,,
,Place value and face value,Face value for 2 and 3 digit numerals,Face Value is the actual value of the digit in a number and hence is not determined by its place. ,,,,
,,,Any digit placed at units place will always have the same place value and face value. ,,,,
,,,The face value as well as the place value of 0 is always 0 irrespective of its position in the number.,,,,
,,,The face value of a digit multiplied by the value of its place gives the place value of the digit. ,,,,
,,," If a digit is repeated in a number, it will have the same face value but not the same place value. ",,,,
,Expanded and Standard Form,Expanded Form for 2 and 3 digit, Expanded form of a number is splitting the number according to the place value of each of its digits. ,,,,
,,," To represent a number in its expanded form, multiply each digit including 0 with its place value and express the products obtained as a sum.
",,,,
,,,"A number can also be expressed in its expanded form, by representing the place value of each of its digits as a power of 10. ",,,,
,Expanded and Standard Form,Standard Form,A number is in its standard form if it is expressed by digits only. ,,,,

To convert the expanded form into standard form , find the sum of individual terms in the expanded form of the number.",,,,
,Writing number names,How to write numbers,Number name is a way of expressing a number in the word form. ,,,,
,,, Single digit numbers have unique number names and are used to express ten's place value for two and higher digit numbers.  ,,,,
,,,"Though numbers from 11 to 19 have two digits, they are expressed as a single unit and are used to express one's and ten's place value for three and higher digit numbers. ",,,,
,,,"To write number names for 2-digit numbers from 20 onwards, write the expanded form of the number and use the number names for multiples of 10 followed by the number names for the one's place. ",,,,
,,,"To write number names for 3-digit number, add hundred to the number name of the digit at the hundred's place followed by the number name at the ten's place and one's place. 
",,,,
,,,Zero at any place value is not included in number names.,,,,
,Representation of numbers on the Number Line,Representation of a single digit number on a number line , A number line is a pictorial representation of numbers on a horizontal or vertical straight line.,,,,
,,,"To represent numbers, mark points of equal intervals on to the right of the origin point 0.

",,,,
,,,"On a number line, as we move towards the right, the value of numbers increases.",,,,
,,,Arrows marked at the ends of the number line shows that infinite numbers can be plotted on the number line. ,,,,

,Comparison (upto 3-digit number),Comparison using base 10 blocks," Comparing numbers means identifying if one number is equal to, less than or greater than the other number. ",,,,
,,,"To symbolically represent the comparison between numbers, the less than (<), greater than (>) and equal to (=) signs are used. ",,,,
,,, Comparing numbers helps to relate numbers with each other.,,,,
,,,To compare single digit numbers using base ten blocks compare unit cubes. The number with more number of unit cubes is greater. ,,,,
,,,"To compare 2-digit numbers compare longs first since longs represent the number of tens and tens are greater than ones. The number of longs being equal, compare the unit cubes since unit cubes represent the digit at the one's place. ",,,,
,,,"To compare 3 - digit numbers using base 10 blocks, compare flats, followed by longs and unit cubes; since blocks are compared in the order of the place values they represent. ",,,,
,Comparison (upto 3-digit number),Comparison using number line,The number which is on the right on the number line is greater than the number on its left,,,,
,,,The number with more digits is always a greater number than the number with fewer digits.,,,,

",,,,
,Comparison (upto 3-digit number),Arrange in order ,The number with the least number of digits is the smallest and the number with the most number of digits is the greatest; since the value of a number increases as the digits in a number increases. ,,,,
,,, To compare 2 digit numbers; compare the digits at the ten's place value followed by the digit at the one's place; since tens are greater than ones.,,,,
,,,To compare 3 digit numbers compare the digit at the hundred's place followed by the digit at the ten's place and one's place; since hundreds are greater than tens and tens are greater than ones.,,,,
,,,"To arrange numbers in ascending order, compare the numbers and arrange them from the lowest value to the highest value by placing < sign between the numbers.",,,,
